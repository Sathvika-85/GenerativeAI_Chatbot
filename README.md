A generative AI chatbot is designed to generate human-like responses in conversation. It uses deep learning models, such as transformers, to understand language patterns and generate contextually relevant text based on the input it receives. These chatbots don't rely on pre-programmed responses but instead generate new text based on their training data and the context of the conversation. They aim to simulate natural conversation and can be used for various purposes like customer service, information retrieval, entertainment, and more.
It offers dynamic, human-like conversations, adapting and learning continuously.It's like chatting with a friend, powered by AI!
